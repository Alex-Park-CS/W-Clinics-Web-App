## 5. Known Bugs and Limitations
Here are some known bugs/limitations:
* Does not connections with actual clinics, so will not be able to apply in in the real world
* The map feature does not have a navigation feature, so user must copy paste the address into another navigation app
* Visual design of the app is not as appealing as some other apps

## 6. Features for Future
What we'd like to build in the future:
* Navigation feature in app
* real-time chat service with appointment clinics directly
